    <h1>Welcome! This is the first go at me building my own page.</h1>
    <p>It's exciting! It really is.</p>
    <p>But TBH... it's also a little <em>...scary.</em>

    <h2>So I'm trying to look at it like learning another spoken language.</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the languages I've learned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>English was my first language</li>
      <li>Spanish was what I took in high school</li>
      <li>I took a quarter of French after that, but it just wasn't for me</li>
      <li>I finally started learning Japanese in college, and I liked it enough to make it my minor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>On an entirely separate note, we got a <strong>ton</strong> of snow today!</h3>
    <p>It's the day after Christmas, so I'm sure people are pretty excited about it.</p>
    <h4>Here are some things I like about snow:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Snow covers up the fact that I haven't been able to mow my lawn since the end of summer</li>
      <li>It's an excuse to stay inside and be cozy, instead of blaming it on laziness</li>
      <li>When you go out and shovel, it gives you a chance to catch up with your neighbors</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Speaking of Christmas, you should <i>totally</i> check out this skiing avocado ornament I got, it's pretty great.</h3>
